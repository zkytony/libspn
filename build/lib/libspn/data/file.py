class FileDataset(Dataset):
    """An abstract class for a dataset stored in a file.

    Args:
        files (str or list of str): A string containing a path to a file or a
              glob matching multiple files, or a list of paths to multiple
              files. When glob is used, the files will be sorted, unless
              ``shuffle`` is set to ``True``. If a part of a path is wrapped in
              curly braces, it will be extracted as a label for the file. This
              works even for a glob, e.g. ``dir/{*}.jpg`` will use the filename
              without the extension as the label. For files without a label
              specification, the returned label is an empty string.
        num_vars (int): Number of variables in each data sample.
        num_vals (int or list of int): Number of values of each variable. Can be
            a single value or a list of values, one for each of ``num_vars``
            variables. Use ``None``, to indicate that a variable is continuous,
            in the range ``[0, 1]``.
        num_labels (int): Number of labels for each data sample.
        num_epochs (int): Number of epochs of produced data.
        batch_size (int): Size of a single batch.
        shuffle (bool): Shuffle data within each epoch.
        shuffle_batch (bool): Shuffle data when generating batches.
        min_after_dequeue (int): Min number of elements in the data queue after
                                 each dequeue. This is the minimum number of
                                 elements from which the shuffled batch will
                                 be drawn. Relevant only if ``shuffle_batch``
                                 is ``True``.
        num_threads (int): Number of threads enqueuing the data queue. If
                           larger than ``1``, the performance will be better,
                           but examples might not be in order even if
                           ``shuffle_batch`` is ``False``. If ``shuffle_batch``
                           is ``True``, this might lead to examples repeating in
                           the same batch.
        allow_smaller_final_batch(bool): If ``False``, the last batch will be
                                         omitted if it has less elements than
                                         ``batch_size``.
        classes (list of int): Optional. If specified, only files with labels
                               listed here will be provided.
        seed (int): Optional. Seed used when shuffling.
